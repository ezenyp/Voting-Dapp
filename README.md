# Setting up Metamask

2. After installation, it'll take you to a window to set a password. Select the option to import wallet from seed phrase and set a password.
3. Use the mnemonic from the ganache instance.
4. A localhost blockchain would be added in the list of networks. Change the port number to 7545. Set the chain id as 1337.
5. Then you'll see, metamask will ask your permission to connect all the 10 accounts to the webapp.
6. Initially only the first account would be connected. Click on add account, then the second account would be added, then third and so on.

# Setting up the local development environment

```
git clone https://github.com/Yohenba18/Voting-Dapp.git

git pull origin newbranch

npm install

truffle compile

truffle migrate (or truffle migrate --reset)

cd client

npm install

npm start
```

(truffle migrate if using for the first time. truffle migrate --reset for everytime you want to create a new contract instance and wipe out the old data.)
(For running the application anytime afterwards, just start the Ganache workspace created and go to the client folder and npm start)
